Warning - Live malware, user assumes all risk.

Samples are organized by MD5 hash, and writeups are in the same directories.

Writeups are in the Wiki. Data likely isn't complete. If I missed something, be sure to ping me - learning is always a good thing.

Shouts to ytisf's theZoo (https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo), where a lot of these samples came from.

Thanks
