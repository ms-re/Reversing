# Reverse-engineering results and analysis

Warning - Live malware, user assumes all risk.

Writeups are in the [Wiki](https://github.com/ms-re/Reversing/wiki). Data likely isn't complete. If I missed something, be sure to ping me - learning is always a good thing. Samples are organized by MD5 hash.

Shouts to ytisf's theZoo (https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo), where a lot of these samples came from.

Thanks
